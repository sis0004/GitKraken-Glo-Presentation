## Project Management Tools: Issue/Task Tracking Boards
How i was introduced to this tool
I was introduced to them as scrum boards but they're also called Issue boards.  

### What are they used for?
Issue tracking/scrum boards are useful tools because they can be used for 
  - Collaborative projects: planning, communication, progress reports
  - they are a great way to help with workflow on a team and personally

### Why?
 - Sometimes communication is hard. With issue tracking boards, everyone on the project is on the same page (literally). It allows for easy visualization of tasks. 
 
### What are scrum boards?
- Scrum boards are a common workflow tool used by development teams and can be extremely useful tools. 
Imagine it as a way to organize all the post it note "to-do's" you may have floating around your desk (maybe it's just me). Typically, they contain three columns: To-do, In progress, and Completed, but you can customize what works for you. 
Physical boards have the same idea, but online boards allow for much greater versatility. 

### What options are out there?
The most widely used in software development is Trello, but GitKraken Glo boards are becoming more popular. They serve the same purpose, but I feel that Glo boards are more user friendly and versatile. They're free to use, but also offer premium features. 

GitHub also has a version of this, but it is not as user friendly and doesn't have all of the same features. 

Let's start with Glo boards. GitKraken is a Git client, we talked about clients briefly in class one day. Glo boards are an additional feature of this particular client. 

### Main Components:
 * Boards- usually one for a repo/project
 * Columns- how to organize your tasks
 * Cards- specific tasks
 
### GitKraken Glo boards:

Start with a bunch of cards in a to do column; add card features to them live. 
move cards to another column. Add a column of non-priority?
switch to calendar view to assign due dates


### Card features:
* Invite collaborators to the board. Editing access can be allowed or denied. 
    - settings -> users -> invite
* Assign: Assign who should be working on a particular card
* Description: describe the task. 
    - Can use markdown to emphasize text 
    - Attach photos, videos, and documents
* Lists: items to do within the task. progress bar as you check them off 
* Labels: tag cards, makes filtering cards easier. 
    - Ex: tag 'high priority' tasks
* Pull requests: link a card to a pull request and automatically change the column a card is in based on the status of the pull request. 
    - settings -> pull requests -> Connect with GitHub repos, select pull request, define which column
* Calendar: Attach due dates or assign a milestone. View in calendar. click and drag to either change or assign due dates. Milestones are great tools to segment pieces of the project and stay on track. Set deadlines for pieces of the project
  - ex: I want to have all of my data munging done by Friday. Creating plots and site maps should be done by 12/12. 
* plugins to text editors such as Atom or to visual studios
  - Atom: Atom -> Preferences -> Install -> search 'gitkraken-glo' -> install
     - a shortcut to your Glo boards will be in the bottom right corner

Fun little things: 
 * emoji reactions
 * add gifs 
    - files and images -> set to cover image
    
Search and filter cards--- by tag, who is assigned, due date, or name of card

Pro: more features; extremely user friendly; desktop, web, and mobile enabled 
Con: 

### Trello:

Trello has many of the same card features as Glo boards, but I find the calendar tool to be extremely useful and that is a premuim feature on Trello. 

Pro: many people use it, easy to find templates
Con: a little more bulky, not all features are free

### GitHub Issues and Projects:
GitHub has their own version that is similar, but not as good in my opinion. 
It is split up between Project Boards and Issues. Project boards is where you would create columns and cards, but the cards are only notes. For more than just a note, it must be an issue. You can either create an issue and assign it to the board, or convert a card to an issue and edit it in the Issue tab.
Once an issue is created, it has a few optional features such as assigning users, labels, and milestones. 
- Can't integrate across repos like Glo

Pro: Already on GitHub
Con: frustrating to navigate once you're used to Glo/Trello

### What else can I do?
Examples of templates on Trello for other uses
 - Plants
 - Vacation planning
