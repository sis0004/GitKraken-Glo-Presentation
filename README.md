## Project Management Tools: Issue Tracking Boards
How i was introduced to this tool

### What are they used for?
In summary, issue tracking/scrum boards are useful tools because they can be used for 
  - Collaborative projects: planning, communication, progress reports
  - they are a great way to help with workflow on a team and personally
  - and more

### Why?
 - Sometimes communication is hard. With issue tracking boards, everyone on the project is on the same page (literally). It allows for easy visualization of tasks. 
 
Idea of scrum boards
- Scrum boards are a common workflow tool used by development teams. Scrum boards, descpite the name are extremely useful tools. 
physical boards have the same idea, but online boards allow for much greater versatility. 

### Main Components:
 * Boards- usually one for a repo/project
 * Columns- how to organize your tasks
 * Cards- specific tasks
 
### What options are out there?
The most widely used in software development is Trello, but GitKraken Glo boards are becoming more popular. They serve the same purpose, but I feel that Glo boards are more user friendly and versatile. They're free to use, but also offer premium features. 

GitHub also has a version of this, but it is not as user friendly and doesn't have all of the same features. 

Let's start with Glo boards. GitKraken is a Git client. We talked about them briefly in class one day. 
 
### GitKraken Glo boards:

Start with a bunch of cards in a to do column; add card features to them live. 
move cards to another column. Add a column of non-priority?
switch to calendar view to assign due dates


### Card features: https://support.gitkraken.com/glo/card-features/#milestones
Invite collaborators to the board. Editing access can be allowed or denied. 
Assign: Assign who should be working on a particular card
Description: describe the task. Can use markdown to emphasize text. attach photos, videos, and documents
Lists: items to do within the task. as you check them off 
Calendar: Attach due dates or assign a milestone. View in calendar. click and drag to either change or assign due dates
Labels make filtering cards easier

Search and filter cards
Pro: more features, extremely user friendly, plugins to text editiors and visual studios, desktop, web, and mobile, 
Con: 

### GitHub Issues and Projects:
GitHub has their own version that is similar, but not as good in my opinion. 
It is split up between Project Boards and Issues. Project boards is where you would create columns and cards, but the cards are only notes. For more than just a note, it must be an issue. You can either create an issue and assign it to the board, or convert a card to an issue and edit it in the Issue tab.
Once an issue is created, it has a few optional features such as assigning users, labels, and milestones. 
- Can't integrate across repos like Glo

Pro: Already on GitHub
Con: frustrating to navigate once you're used to Glo/Trello


### Trello:

Trello has many of the same card features as Glo boards, but I find the calendar tool to be extremely useful and that is a premuim feature on Trello. 

Examples of templates on Trello for other uses
 - Plants
 - Vacation planning
Pro: many people use it, easy to find templates
Con: a little more bulky, not all features are free


Functionality: extremely user friendly

Integration with Git and other features: 
Plugins with Atom or other visual studios
Sync with GitHub
Pull request automation
