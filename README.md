## Project Management Tools: Issue Tracking Boards

### What are they used for?
In summary, issue tracking boards are useful tools because they can be used for 
  - Collaborative projects: planning, communication, progress reports
  - Whatever else you want!


What's out there?
The most widely used is Trello, but GitKraken Glo boards are becoming more popular. They serve the same purpose, but I feel that Glo boards are more user friendly and versatile. 

They're both free to use, but also offer premium features. 

Why?

 - Sometimes communication is hard. With issue tracking boards, everyone on the project is on the same page (literally). It allows for easy visualization of tasks. 

### Main Components:
 * Boards- usually one for a repo
 * Columns- how to organize your tasks
 * Cards- specific tasks
    - Cards have many features
 * labels
